4vol, a single-speaker mono audio power quadrupler for JACK

With one loudspeaker and a stereo output you can get four times the
audio power (twice what you'd get with a stereo pair) by connecting the
speaker to the positive terminals of the left and right channels and using
this plugin in the signal path. It averages the two channels into one mono
channel and puts plus that on the left channel and minus that on the right
thereby doubling the voltage to the speaker, wuich quadruples the power.

I hope your sound card can stand the higher current without burning out!
