4vol, a single-speaker mono audio power quadrupler for JACK
    
I only have one working speaker (and a very nice one too!) but driven
from the headphone output of my laptop it is rather quiet and, of course,
you only hear one channel. 4vol averages the two channels to mono and
sends plus this to the left channel and minus this to the right.
The speaker is connected between the left and right signal leads from
the headphone output and gets twice the voltage between its terminals
hence four times the power.

Make sure your headphone output amplifier can handle the double current!
